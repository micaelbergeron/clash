Clash
==============

Clash is a tool that I designed to be a companion for any turn by turn board games. It can be used to keep track of turns, events and status of multiple entities and is configurable.

The initial use-case for this tool is to be use by DM in D&D games - to help manage fights.

_Keep in mind that this is a work in progress._


## Installation

For now there are no deployment/packaging strategies, but it will probably use flatpak or docker.
To run from source, simply use `npm start`.


## How to use

The main design goal of Clash is to stay out of the way and not distract its user. The UI is very minimal, reminding of a terminal, where most of the screen space is used to display meaninfull information.

Every action in the menu will be accessible using a keyboard chord, inspired by Vim/Emacs. The displayed information should use a view that is configurable, depending on the state of the game (exploration, fights, diplomacy, etc...)
